    STATIC LIBRARY : VerrevEngine2D Project Overview
========================================================================

VerrevEngine2D is a game engine written in C++. It uses Direct2D for it's renderer. Interoperability
with Direct3D is supported as well, and is easy to set up, requiring the user to call one of two
different CD2DRenderer::init functions. The engine structure has a lot of thought put into it
and making applications with it is simple and reduces the amout of code the programmer has to write.
The engine can be used to build standalone applications as well as programs that are to be built as
dynamic link libraries (DLL's) to be injected into host processes. 
For a brief tutorial as to how exactly to use this engine in your own project, see FirstInstructions.txt.
